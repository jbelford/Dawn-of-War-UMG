# Dawn of War: Ultimate Matchup Generator

An application that reads Dawn of War files to do some cool stuff.
This project involved reverse engineering quite a few old relic file formats (RGD, SGA, SGB) to be able to detect basically all the
relevant custom data a user might have in their Dawn of War install folder. (Ex: Mods, Maps, Races, Game Rules)

Once all this data is loaded I used it to create a simple matchup generator where you can filter out certain types of maps.

Still a work in progress as a lot of the functionality isn't even fully implemented like having the team compositions generated.
